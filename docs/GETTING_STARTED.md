# Getting Started with JavaMT5

> **Welcome to JavaMT5** - a comprehensive educational project for learning MT5 trading automation from the ground up. This guide will show you the learning path and what opportunities this project opens for you.

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites and Setup

Before you start working with JavaMT5, you need to set up your development environment.

### Step 1: Install Java (JDK 11 or higher)

JavaMT5 requires Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher.

**Download and Install:**

- **Recommended:** [Eclipse Adoptium JDK](https://adoptium.net/) (formerly AdoptOpenJDK)
- **Alternative:** [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

**Verify installation:**

```bash
java -version
# Should show: java version "11" or higher
```

**Set JAVA_HOME environment variable:**

- Windows: Add to System Environment Variables
  ```
  JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-11.0.x-hotspot
  ```
- Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to PATH

---

### Step 2: Install Maven Daemon (mvnd)

JavaMT5 uses Maven Daemon for fast builds and execution.

**Download:**

- Visit [Maven Daemon releases](https://github.com/apache/maven-mvnd/releases)
- Download the latest version for Windows (e.g., `maven-mvnd-1.0.3-windows-amd64.zip`)

**Install:**

1. Extract to a permanent location (e.g., `C:\Users\<your-username>\maven-mvnd-1.0.3-windows-amd64`)
2. Add to PATH or update `run.bat` with your path
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   mvnd --version
   # Should show Maven Daemon version
   ```

**Configure run.bat:**

Edit `run.bat` and update the MVND path if needed:
```batch
set "MVND=C:\Users\<your-username>\maven-mvnd-1.0.3-windows-amd64\bin\mvnd.cmd"
```

---

### Step 3: Configure MetaRPC Gateway Connection

JavaMT5 connects to MT5 terminal via the **MetaRPC gRPC gateway** - a Java library that provides MT5 terminal integration.

**What is MetaRPC?**

- GitHub package: `com.github.MetaRPC.metarpcmt5`
- Provides gRPC communication with MT5 terminal
- Already included in `pom.xml` dependencies
- See: [MetaRPC on GitHub Packages](https://github.com/MetaRPC/JavaMT5/packages/2470968)

**Two ways to connect:**

#### Option A: Connect to Your Own MT5 Terminal (Local)

If you have MT5 installed locally with MetaRPC server running:

1. Ensure MT5 terminal is running
2. MetaRPC gRPC server must be running in MT5
3. Configure `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "MT5": {
    "Host": "localhost",
    "Port": 5555,
    "Login": 12345678,
    "Password": "your_password",
    "Symbol": "EURUSD",
    "UseSSL": false,
    "TimeoutSeconds": 30
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Connect to Remote MetaRPC Gateway (Provided by MetaRPC)

If MetaRPC team provides access to their gateway:

1. Obtain connection credentials from MetaRPC
2. Configure `appsettings.json` with provided settings:

```json
{
  "MT5": {
    "Host": "gateway.metarpc.com",     // Provided by MetaRPC
    "Port": 5555,                      // Provided by MetaRPC
    "Login": 123456,                   // Your MT5 account number
    "Password": "your_password",       // Your MT5 password
    "Symbol": "EURUSD",
    "UseSSL": true,                    // Usually true for remote
    "TimeoutSeconds": 30
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Clone and Build the Project

**Clone repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MetaRPC/JavaMT5.git
cd JavaMT5
```

**Understanding run.bat - Your Project Lifecycle Manager:**

The `run.bat` script is the central command that manages the entire JavaMT5 project lifecycle:

- **Runs examples** from the `examples/` folder (commands 1-9)
- **Runs orchestrators** - trading strategies (commands 10 1-5)
- **Runs presets** - multi-strategy systems (commands 11 1-2)
- **Auto-checks generated files** on every execution
- **Uses pre-compiled MetaRPC library** (no protobuf generation needed)
- **Compiles the project** before running

**What happens when you run `.\run.bat 7`:**
```
1. Maven downloads MetaRPC library (if not cached)
2. Compiles all Java source files
3. Launches SimpleTradingScenario example
```

This ensures every run starts with a fresh, complete build.

**For complete command reference and troubleshooting:**
See [RUNNING_EXAMPLES.md](./RUNNING_EXAMPLES.md) for:
- All available commands (1-11)
- How to fix compilation errors
- How to handle hanging processes
- Build process details

---

**First build:**
```bash
# Windows CMD or PowerShell
.\run.bat 7

# This will:
# 1. Download all Maven dependencies (including MetaRPC library)
# 2. Compile the project
# 3. Run SimpleTradingScenario example
```

**If you get errors:**
- See [RUNNING_EXAMPLES.md](./RUNNING_EXAMPLES.md) for troubleshooting
- Common fix: Delete `target/` folder and try again
  ```bash
  rmdir /s /q target
  .\run.bat 7
  ```

---

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works

**Test the setup:**
```bash
# Run a simple example
.\run.bat 7    # SimpleTradingScenario

# If it connects and runs - you're ready!
# If you see errors - check RUNNING_EXAMPLES.md
```

**Expected output:**
```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
Configuration loaded: user=123456
