## Step 0: Obtain Your API Key

To connect to MetaRPC endpoints (`mt5.mrpc.pro:443`), obtain your API key:
1. Register for free at [https://mrpc.pro/signup](https://mrpc.pro/signup).
2. Generate your API token in your dashboard at [https://mrpc.pro/my](https://mrpc.pro/my).
3. Set your token in your environment or connection config.

## Step 1: Create Your Project

Create a new directory for your trading bot:

```bash
mkdir my_javamt5_bot
cd my_javamt5_bot
```

Install the package:

```bash
implementation 'pro.mrpc:mt5:1.0.0'
```

## Step 2: Write Your Trading Code

Create your main application file and paste the following snippet:

```
import pro.mrpc.mt5.MT5Account;
import pro.mrpc.mt5.models.AccountSummary;

MT5Account account = new MT5Account(user, password, grpcServer);
account.connectByServerNameAsync(serverName, "EURUSD", 30).get();
AccountSummary summary = account.accountSummaryAsync().get();
System.out.println("Balance: " + summary.getAccountBalance());
```

## Step 3: Run the Program

Run your application:

```bash
# Verify connection output
# Balance: 10000.00, Equity: 10000.00
```
