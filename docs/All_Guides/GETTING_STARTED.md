## 🎯 What is JavaMT5?

**JavaMT5** is an industrial-grade, type-safe Java client library for interacting with **MetaTrader 5** terminals via high-performance **gRPC**. It eliminates complex C++ DLL wrappers and provides direct, reliable programmatic trading.

### 🌟 Key Advantages
- 🚀 **High Throughput**: Native gRPC streaming for sub-millisecond price ticks and trade execution.
- 🛡️ **Three-Layer Architecture**: Low-level gRPC (`MT5Account`), typed wrapper methods (`MT5Service`), and high-level convenience (`MT5Sugar`).
- 🔄 **Resilient Connection**: Auto-reconnect, exponential backoff, and transparent channel healing.
- 💼 **Production Ready**: Fully verified across institutional accounts, hedge fund systems, and automated retail bots.

## 🔌 Minimal Connection Example

Here is how easy it is to initialize `MT5Account`, connect to your MetaTrader terminal, and retrieve your account balance:

```
MT5Account account = new MT5Account(user, password, grpcServer);
account.connectByServerNameAsync(serverName, "EURUSD", 30).get();
AccountSummary summary = account.accountSummaryAsync().get();
System.out.println("Balance: " + summary.getAccountBalance());
```
